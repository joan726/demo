      <description>This paper presents BigDL (a distributed deep learning framework for Apache Spark), which has been used by a variety of users in the industry for building deep learning applications on production big data platforms. It allows deep learning applications to run on the Apache Hadoop/Spark cluster so as to directly process the production data, and as a part of the end-to-end data analysis pipeline for deployment and management. </description>

      <description>Real-time recommender systems are critical for the success of the e-commerce industry. Training deep neural networks (DNNs) of recommender systems at scale is challenging at Office Depot*. This project shares the experience and lessons learned from Office Depot and the Intel team in building an efficient, real-time DNN-based recommender system using Analytics Zoo1 and Apache Spark* on Amazon Web Services (AWS)*, all with the goal of increasing revenue per visit to the website.</description>

      <title>Scalable AutoML for Time Series Prediction Using Ray</title>
      <link>https://joan726.github.io/project/large-scale-surveillance/</link>

      <description>In order to provide an easy-to-use time series prediction toolkit, we have applied Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) to time series prediction. In particular, we have automated the process of feature generation, model selection and hyper-parameter tuning. The toolkit is built on top of Ray* (a distributed framework for advanced AI applications open-sourced by UC Berkeley RISELab), and is provided as a part of Analytic Zoo (a unified data analytics and AI platform open sourced by Intel).</description>
